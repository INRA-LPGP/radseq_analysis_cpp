# EASY
- Merge bootstrap into filtering (no function call)
- Don't create a new array for the combination, instead modify a former array

# HARD
- Parallelize (Find a function to give next permutation from a given permutation, used for chunking without storing data)
- Optimize combination generation (does it even matter ...)
- Better tree walking algorithm (this should be possible!)
